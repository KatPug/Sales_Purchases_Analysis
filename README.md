# Data Preprocessing and Tableau Dashboard for Order Analytics

## Project Overview
This repository contains the work Iâ€™ve done for an order analytics project, focusing on data preprocessing and visualization. The project involves analyzing order data to provide insights into product sales, purchases, and operational efficiency. The deliverables include a Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing and a Tableau dashboard for visualizing the processed data.

### Data Preprocessing (Jupyter Notebook):

The notebook includes steps for cleaning and preparing the raw data, handling missing values, filtering relevant information, and creating new variables for analysis.
Key operations include data transformation, feature engineering, and ensuring data consistency.

### Tableau Dashboard:

A set of visualizations that display critical metrics and trends from the order data

### Technologies Used

Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing and analysis
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) for data manipulation and visualization
Tableau for data visualization and dashboard creation
